# Quiz3

This this the third creating a quiz app as a learning exercise but always fun to work on and use with friends later.

Elements / challenges this time:

* No web framework (routing through gorilla mux)
* Getting the hang of GORM
* Implement websockets with concurrent quiz rooms
* Embed UI files
* Deploy to serverless container
* Cockroach db as database
